5.0.0 / 2017-12-11
------------------

Significant refactor of `copy()` & `copySync()`, including breaking changes. No changes to other functions in this release.

Huge thanks to **[@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou)** for doing most of the work on this release.

- The `filter` option can no longer be a RegExp (must be a function). This was deprecated since fs-extra v1.0.0. [#512](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/512)
- `copy()`'s `filter` option can now be a function that returns a Promise. [#518](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/518)
- `copy()` & `copySync()` now use `fs.copyFile()`/`fs.copyFileSync()` in environments that support it (currently Node 8.5.0+). Older Node versions still get the old implementation. [#505](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/505)
- Don't allow copying a directory into itself. [#83](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/83)
- Handle copying between identical files. [#198](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/198)
- Error out when copying an empty folder to a path that already exists. [#464](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/464)
- Don't create `dest`'s parent if the `filter` function aborts the `copy()` operation. [#517](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/517)
- Fix `writeStream` not being closed if there was an error in `copy()`. [#516](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/516)

4.0.3 / 2017-12-05
------------------

- Fix wrong `chmod` values in `fs.remove()` [#501](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/501)
- Fix `TypeError` on systems that don't have some `fs` operations like `lchown` [#520](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/520)

4.0.2 / 2017-09-12
------------------

- Added `EOL` option to `writeJson*` & `outputJson*` (via upgrade to jsonfile v4)
- Added promise support to [`fs.copyFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_copyfile_src_dest_flags_callback) in Node 8.5+
- Added `.js` extension to `main` field in `package.json` for better tooling compatibility. [#485](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/485)

4.0.1 / 2017-07-31
------------------

### Fixed

- Previously, `ensureFile()` & `ensureFileSync()` would do nothing if the path was a directory. Now, they error out for consistency with `ensureDir()`. [#465](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/465), [#466](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/466), [#470](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/470)

4.0.0 / 2017-07-14
------------------

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** The promisified versions of `fs.read()` & `fs.write()` now return objects. See [the docs](docs/fs-read-write.md) for details. [#436](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/436), [#449](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/449)
- `fs.move()` now errors out when destination is a subdirectory of source. [#458](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/458)
- Applied upstream fixes from `rimraf` to `fs.remove()` & `fs.removeSync()`. [#459](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/459)

### Fixed

- Got `fs.outputJSONSync()` working again; it was broken due to refactoring. [#428](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/428)

Also clarified the docs in a few places.

3.0.1 / 2017-05-04
------------------

- Fix bug in `move()` & `moveSync()` when source and destination are the same, and source does not exist. [#415](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/415)

3.0.0 / 2017-04-27
------------------

### Added

- **BREAKING:** Added Promise support. All asynchronous native fs methods and fs-extra methods now return a promise if the callback is not passed. [#403](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/403)
- `pathExists()`, a replacement for the deprecated `fs.exists`. `pathExists` has a normal error-first callback signature. Also added `pathExistsSync`, an alias to `fs.existsSync`, for completeness. [#406](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/406)

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** Removed support for setting the default spaces for `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()`. This was undocumented. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)

### Changed

- Upgraded jsonfile dependency to v3.0.0:
  - **BREAKING:** Changed behavior of `throws` option for `readJsonSync()`; now does not throw filesystem errors when `throws` is `false`.
- **BREAKING:** `writeJson()`, `writeJsonSync()`, `outputJson()`, & `outputJsonSync()` now output minified JSON by default for consistency with `JSON.stringify()`; set the `spaces` option to `2` to override this new behavior. [#402](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/402)
- Use `Buffer.allocUnsafe()` instead of `new Buffer()` in environments that support it. [#394](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/394)

### Fixed

- `removeSync()` silently failed on Windows in some cases. Now throws an `EBUSY` error. [#408](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/408)

2.1.2 / 2017-03-16
------------------

### Fixed

- Weird windows bug that resulted in `ensureDir()`'s callback being called twice in some cases. This bug may have also affected `remove()`. See [#392](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/392), [#393](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/393)

2.1.1 / 2017-03-15
------------------

### Fixed

- Reverted [`5597bd`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/commit/5597bd5b67f7d060f5f5bf26e9635be48330f5d7), this broke compatibility with Node.js versions v4+ but less than `v4.5.0`.
- Remove `Buffer.alloc()` usage in `moveSync()`.

2.1.0 / 2017-03-15
------------------

Thanks to [Mani Maghsoudlou (@manidlou)](https://github.com/manidlou) & [Jan Peer St√∂cklmair (@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264) for their extraordinary help with this release!

### Added
- `moveSync()` See [#309], [#381](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/381). ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- `copy()` and `copySync()`'s `filter` option now gets the destination path passed as the second parameter. [#366](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/366) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Changed
- Use `Buffer.alloc()` instead of deprecated `new Buffer()` in `copySync()`. [#380](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/380) ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))
- Refactored entire codebase to use ES6 features supported by Node.js v4+ [#355](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/355). [(@JPeer264)](https://github.com/JPeer264)
- Refactored docs. ([@manidlou](https://github.com/manidlou))

### Fixed

- `move()` shouldn't error out when source and dest are the same. [#377](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/issues/377), [#378](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra/pull/378) ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

2.0.0 / 2017-01-16
------------------

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed support for Node `v0.12`. The Node foundation stopped officially supporting it
on Jan 1st, 2017.
- **BREAKING:** Remove `walk()` and `walkSync()`. `walkSync()` was only part of `fs-extra` for a little
over two months. Use [klaw](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw) instead of `walk()`, in fact, `walk()` was just
an alias to klaw. For `walkSync()` use [klaw-sync](https://github.com/mawni/node-klaw-sync). See: [#338], [#339]

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Renamed `clobber` to `overwrite`. This affects `copy()`, `copySync()`, and `move()`. [#330], [#333]
- Moved docs, to `docs/`. [#340]

### Fixed
- Apply filters to directories in `copySync()` like in `copy()`. [#324]
- A specific condition when disk is under heavy use, `copy()` can fail. [#326]


1.0.0 / 2016-11-01
------------------

After five years of development, we finally have reach the 1.0.0 milestone! Big thanks goes
to [Ryan Zim](https://github.com/RyanZim) for leading the charge on this release!

### Added
- `walkSync()`

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: dropped Node v0.10 support.
- disabled `rimaf` globbing, wasn't used. [#280]
- deprecate `copy()/copySync()` option `filter` if it's a `RegExp`. `filter` should now be a function.
- inline `rimraf`. This is temporary and was done because `rimraf` depended upon the beefy `glob` which `fs-extra` does not use. [#300]

### Fixed
- bug fix proper closing of file handle on `utimesMillis()` [#271]
- proper escaping of files with dollar signs [#291]
- `copySync()` failed if user didn't own file. [#199], [#301]


0.30.0 / 2016-04-28
-------------------
- Brought back Node v0.10 support. I didn't realize there was still demand. Official support will end **2016-10-01**.

0.29.0 / 2016-04-27
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed support for Node v0.10. If you still want to use Node v0.10, everything should work except for `ensureLink()/ensureSymlink()`. Node v0.12 is still supported but will be dropped in the near future as well.

0.28.0 / 2016-04-17
-------------------
- **BREAKING**: removed `createOutputStream()`. Use https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-output-stream. See: [#192][#192]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` check for invalid win32 path chars. See: [#209][#209], [#237][#237]
- `mkdirs()/mkdirsSync()` if drive not mounted, error. See: [#93][#93]

0.27.0 / 2016-04-15

-------------------
- fixed `copy()` if source and dest are the same. [#230][#230]

0.26.6 / 2016-03-15
-------------------
- fixed if `emptyDir()` does not have a callback: [#229][#229]

0.26.5 / 2016-01-27
-------------------
- `copy()` with two arguments (w/o callback) was broken. See: [#215][#215]

0.26.4 / 2016-01-05
-------------------
- `copySync()` made `preserveTimestamps` default consistent with `copy()` which is `false`. See: [#208][#208]

0.26.3 / 2015-12-17
-------------------
- fixed `copy()` hangup in copying blockDevice / characterDevice / `/dev/null`. See: [#193][#193]

0.26.2 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `outputJson{Sync}()` spacing adherence to `fs.spaces`

0.26.1 / 2015-11-02
-------------------
- fixed `copySync()` when `clogger=true` and the destination is read only. See: [#190][#190]

0.26.0 / 2015-10-25
-------------------
- extracted the `walk()` function into its own module [`klaw`](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-klaw).

0.25.0 / 2015-10-24
-------------------
- now has a file walker `walk()`

0.24.0 / 2015-08-28
-------------------
- removed alias `delete()` and `deleteSync()`. See: [#171][#171]

0.23.1 / 2015-08-07
-------------------
- Better handling of errors for `move()` when moving across devices. [#170][#170]
- `ensureSymlink()` and `ensureLink()` should not throw errors if link exists. [#169][#169]

0.23.0 / 2015-08-06
-------------------
- added `ensureLink{Sync}()` and `ensureSymlink{Sync}()`. See: [#165][#165]

0.22.1 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- Prevent calling `hasMillisResSync()` on module load. See: [#149][#149].
Fixes regression that was introduced in `0.21.0`.

0.22.0 / 2015-07-09
-------------------
- preserve permissions / ownership in `copy()`. See: [#54][#54]

0.20.1 / 2015-06-23
-------------------
- fixed regression caused by latest jsonfile update: See: https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile/issues/26

0.20.0 / 2015-06-19
-------------------
- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren't documented and probably weren't in use e.g.
this package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.
- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.
- started moving tests inline
- upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`

0.19.0 / 2015-06-08

- `fs.copy()` had support for Node v0.8, dropped support

0.18.4 / 2015-05-22

- fixed a lot of tests for Windows (appveyor)

0.18.0 / 2015-03-31
-------------------
- added `emptyDir()` and `emptyDirSync()`

0.17.0 / 2015-03-28
-------------------
- `copySync` added `clobber` option (before always would clobber, now if `clobber` is `false` it throws an error if the destination exists).
**Only works with files at the moment.**
- `createOutputStream()` added. See: [#118][#118]

0.16.5 / 2015-03-08
-------------------
- fixed `fs.move` when `clobber` is `true` and destination is a directory, it should clobber. [#114][#114]

0.16.4 / 2015-03-01

0.13.0 / 2014-12-10
-------------------
- removed `touch` and `touchSync` methods (they didn't handle permissions like UNIX touch)
- updated `"ncp": "^0.6.0"` to `"ncp": "^1.0.1"`
- imported `mkdirp` => `minimist` and `mkdirp` are no longer dependences, should now appease people who wanted `mkdirp` to be `--use_strict` safe. See [#59]([#59][#59])

* Added `outputFile()` and `outputFileSync()`
* Changed creation of testing diretories so the /tmp dir is not littered.
* Added `readTextFile()` and `readTextFileSync()`.

0.3.2 / 2012-11-01
------------------
* Added `touch()` and `touchSync()` methods.

0.3.1 / 2012-10-11
------------------
* Fixed some stray globals.

0.3.0 / 2012-10-09
------------------
* Removed all CoffeeScript from tests.
* Renamed `mkdir` to `mkdirs`/`mkdirp`.

0.2.1 / 2012-09-11
------------------
* Updated `rimraf` dep.

0.2.0 / 2012-09-10
------------------
* Rewrote module into JavaScript. (Must still rewrite tests into JavaScript)
* Added all methods of [jsonfile](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-jsonfile)
* Added Travis-CI.

0.1.3 / 2012-08-13
------------------
* Added method `readJSONFile`.

0.1.2 / 2012-06-15
------------------
* Bug fix: `deleteSync()` didn't exist.
* Verified Node v0.8 compatibility.

0.1.1 / 2012-06-15
------------------
* Fixed bug in `remove()`/`delete()` that wouldn't execute the function if a callback wasn't passed.

0.1.0 / 2012-05-31
------------------
* Renamed `copyFile()` to `copy()`. `copy()` can now copy directories (recursively) too.
* Renamed `rmrf()` to `remove()`.
* `remove()` aliased with `delete()`.
* Added `mkdirp` capabilities. Named: `mkdir()`. Hides Node.js native `mkdir()`.
* Instead of exporting the native `fs` module with new functions, I now copy over the native methods to a new object and export that instead.

0.0.4 / 2012-03-14
------------------
* Removed CoffeeScript dependency

0.0.3 / 2012-01-11
------------------
* Added methods rmrf and rmrfSync
* Moved tests from Jasmine to Mocha
