# assign-symbols [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assign-symbols.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assign-symbols)

> Assign the enumerable es6 Symbol properties from an object (or objects) to the first object passed on the arguments. Can be used as a supplement to other extend, assign or merge methods as a polyfill for the Symbols part of the es6 Object.assign method.

From the [Mozilla Developer docs for Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol):

> A symbol is a unique and immutable data type and may be used as an identifier for object properties. The symbol object is an implicit object wrapper for the symbol primitive data type.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i assign-symbols --save
```

## Usage

```js
var assignSymbols = require('assign-symbols');
var obj = {};

var one = {};
var symbolOne = Symbol('aaa');
one[symbolOne] = 'bbb';

var two = {};
var symbolTwo = Symbol('ccc');
two[symbolTwo] = 'ddd';

assignSymbols(obj, one, two);

console.log(obj[symbolOne]);
//=> 'bbb'
console.log(obj[symbolTwo]);
//=> 'ddd'
```
